# IMDb-Movies-Insights

Often times, we open Netflix, Prime etc and spends hour choosing which movie to watch. Even with beautiful recommendation engines that these streaming services deploy, it is still frustrating to choose what to watch. At times, 15 minutes into the movie and we realise it's not worth our 2 hours, instead we could use that precious time to scroll through Instagram, just kidding!

Thankfully, we have websited like IMDb which give us a bird's eye view of how the movie actually in terms of popularity, cast, genre etc. for a particular demographic as well as in general. 

Using a dataset with information of about a 100 movies, let us know more about movies!
